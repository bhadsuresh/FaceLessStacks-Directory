### The Problem: The "1-Hour Rule" is dead.
The old rule of video editing was: *"One hour of editing for every one minute of video."*
If you wanted to make a 10-minute YouTube video, you had to budget 10 hours of work. You had to manually cut silence, manually add captions, and manually color grade.

In the fast-paced world of 2026, you don't have that time. If you are spending 10 hours on a video, you are already behind the competition who is uploading daily.

### The Solution: The "10-Minute" AI Workflow.
We have entered the era of **Generative Editing**. AI tools don't just "assist" you; they do the boring work *for* you.
They can listen to your audio and cut out the "umms." They can watch your 1-hour podcast and pick out the viral clips. They can even generate B-roll from thin air.

Here are the 7 tools that will fire your video editor (or at least make them 10x faster).

### The Speed Stack: 7 Tools for 7 Jobs

#### 1. InVideo AI (The "All-in-One" Generator)
**Speed Hack:** Generates Script, Voice, and Visuals instantly.
Instead of sourcing stock footage manually, InVideo searches 10 million clips and syncs them to your script automatically.

#### 2. OpusClip (The "Repurposing" Engine)
**Speed Hack:** turns 1 Long Video into 10 Shorts.
It analyzes your long-form content, finds the hooks, and auto-crops them to vertical 9:16 format with captions. What used to take a day now takes 15 minutes.

#### 3. Descript (The "Text-Based" Editor)
**Speed Hack:** Edit video by deleting text.
Descript transcribes your video into a word doc. If you delete a sentence in the doc, it cuts that scene from the video. It also removes "uh" and "um" automatically.

#### 4. Veed.io (The "Magic Cut" Master)
**Speed Hack:** One-click silence removal.
Veed's "Magic Cut" feature detects every pause in your recording and deletes the silence instantly, creating a jump-cut style video without manual slicing.
