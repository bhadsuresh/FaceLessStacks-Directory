### The Problem: The "Viral but Broke" Trap.
You upload a video. It goes viral and hits 100,000 views. You calculate your riches in your head, thinking you just made $1,000.
Then the check comes in... and it is for $40.

This is the reality for 80% of new faceless creators. They chase "easy" niches like *Relaxing Rain Sounds* or *Funny Animal Compilations*, not realizing that advertisers pay almost nothing for these views.
If you don't understand **RPM (Revenue Per Mille)**, you are playing a lottery where the jackpot is five dollars.

### The Solution: Target "Tier 1" RPM Niches.
Your salary is not determined by how hard you work; it is determined by **who is watching**.
Advertisers pay more to reach "rich" audiences (investors, business owners) than "casual" audiences (gamers, meme watchers).

Here is the actual 2025/2026 salary breakdown per 1,000 views based on data from millions of channels:

* **Finance / Investing:** $12.00 – $22.00 per 1k views (Highest)
* **Tech & Software:** $5.00 – $12.00 per 1k views
* **Motivation / Stoicism:** $2.50 – $4.00 per 1k views
* **Gaming / Entertainment:** $1.00 – $2.00 per 1k views
* **Shorts (Any Niche):** $0.01 – $0.06 per 1k views

**The Math:** A Finance video with 10,000 views earns the same ($150) as a Gaming video with 150,000 views. You can work 15x less for the same paycheck.

### The Tutorial: How to "Spy" on Niche Earnings

You can't see a competitor's dashboard, but you *can* use data tools to predict their profitability before you start.

#### Step 1: Install vidIQ
You need a tool that reveals the "Keyword Value." **vidIQ** is the industry standard for this.

#### Step 2: The "Keywords" Search
* Open the vidIQ dashboard (or browser extension).
* Search for a potential topic, e.g., *"Best Credit Cards 2026"*.
* Look at the **"Competition"** vs. **"Volume"** score.
* **The Money Signal:** Look for keywords with *High Volume* but *Low Competition*. In the Finance niche, these "Golden Keywords" are worth $20+ RPM.

#### Step 3: Check the "Related Keywords" CPC
* vidIQ often shows "CPC" (Cost Per Click) data for related terms.
* If you see keywords like "Insurance," "Software," or "Mortgage" in the related list, you have found a High-RPM goldmine.
* If you see "Free," "Funny," or "Hack," the RPM will likely be low.

#### Step 4: Launch
Build your channel around these high-value keywords using an AI video generator.
