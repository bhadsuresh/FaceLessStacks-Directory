### The Problem: Starting a channel usually costs money.
The "gurus" tell you to buy a $30/month video editor, a $20/month voice generator, and a $15/month stock footage subscription. Before you've even uploaded your first video, you are $65 in the hole.

For most beginners, this financial barrier is the reason they never start. You want to test your idea *before* you invest your savings.

### The Solution: The "Forever Free" AI Stack.
In 2025, the competition between AI companies is so fierce that they are giving away incredible features for free just to get you in the door.

We have curated the ultimate "$0 Stack"—a collection of tools that allow you to write, voice, edit, and publish high-quality videos without pulling out your credit card.

### The Tutorial: Your $0 Workflow

#### 1. ChatGPT (The Script Writer)
**The Role:** Writing your scripts and descriptions.
Most paid writing tools are just wrappers around OpenAI. The free version of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5/4o-mini) is more than capable of writing viral YouTube scripts.
* **How to use it:** Don't just say "Write a script." Use a persona: *"You are an expert YouTube strategist. Write a 1500-word script about 'The History of Coffee' with a hook in the first 10 seconds to retain viewers."*

#### 2. ElevenLabs (The Voice)
**The Role:** Realistic Voiceovers.
While their paid plans are great, ElevenLabs offers a generous **Free Tier** that gives you 10,000 characters per month. That is enough for about 4-5 shorts or one long-form video every month.
* **How to use it:** Sign up for the free plan, paste your ChatGPT intro, and download the audio.

#### 3. Canva (The Visuals)
**The Role:** Thumbnails and Stock Assets.
Canva's free plan is legendary. You get access to thousands of graphics, a free background remover (limited), and thumbnail templates that professional YouTubers actually use.
* **How to use it:** Search for "YouTube Thumbnail." Upload a screenshot from your video, add big bold text (font: 'League Spartan'), and maximize the contrast.

#### 4. CapCut / DaVinci Resolve (The Editor)
**The Role:** Putting it all together.
If you are on mobile, **CapCut** is the king of free editors with auto-captions included. If you are on PC, **DaVinci Resolve** is Hollywood-grade software that is 95% free.
* **How to use it:** Drag your ElevenLabs audio onto the timeline. Overlay stock images (from Pexels/Pixabay) that match what the voice is saying. Use CapCut's "Auto Captions" to generate subtitles instantly.

#### 5. Veed.io (The Polish)
**The Role:** Removing silence and adding waveforms.
Veed's free plan has a watermark, *but* it has powerful tools like "Remove Silence" that can clean up your voiceover in seconds. You can use it for specific clips or Shorts.
