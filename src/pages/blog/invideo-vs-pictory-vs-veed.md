### The Problem: Editing takes too long.
If you are running a faceless YouTube or TikTok channel, you know the grind. You spend 2 hours writing a script, 3 hours finding relevant stock footage, and another 4 hours editing it all together.

For most creators, the "Scripting" phase is the biggest bottleneck. Staring at a blank page is painful. You need a hook, a body, and a call to action that keeps retention high. Doing this manually for every single video is the fastest way to burn out.

### The Solution: AI tools can do it in minutes.
In 2025, you shouldn't be writing scripts from scratch. The top AI video generators don't just "edit" video—they actually **write the video for you**.

But not all tools are created equal. Some are great at summarizing existing blogs, while others can hallucinate an entire documentary from a single sentence.

We tested the "Big 3"—**InVideo AI**, **Pictory**, and **Veed.io**—to see which one actually generates the best scripts for faceless channels.

### The Tutorial: How they compare in action

#### 1. InVideo AI (The "From Scratch" King)
**Best for:** Creators who have an idea but zero script.

InVideo AI is currently the market leader for "Text-to-Video" because its Large Language Model (LLM) is built directly into the video editor.

**How it works:**
1.  **Open the Prompt Box:** You simply type: *"Create a 5-minute documentary about the history of Roman Gladiators. Make the tone dramatic and educational."*
2.  **The Generation:** InVideo doesn't just find clips; it writes a professionally structured script with an Intro, Chapters, and Conclusion.
3.  **The Edit:** It automatically matches the script to stock footage and generates a human-sounding voiceover.

**Verdict:** It writes the most cohesive, "YouTube-ready" scripts out of the box.

#### 2. Pictory (The "Repurposing" King)
**Best for:** Creators turning blog posts into videos.

Pictory takes a different approach. It doesn't "invent" ideas as well as InVideo, but it is a master at **summarization**.

**How it works:**
1.  **Paste a URL:** You take a link to your existing blog post or news article.
2.  **The Extraction:** Pictory's AI reads the article and highlights the "Golden Nuggets"—the most important sentences.
3.  **The Script:** It turns those highlights into a video script automatically.

**Verdict:** Perfect if you already have written content, but it struggles to write an original story from just a simple prompt.
