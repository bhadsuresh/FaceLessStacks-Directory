### The Problem: Editing Shorts is a grind.
You have a 30-minute podcast or YouTube video. You know there are "viral moments" hidden inside it, but finding them is exhausting.

You have to watch the whole video again, write down timestamps, cut the clip, resize it to 9:16 (vertical), keep the subject in the center of the frame, and then manually type out those flashy "Alex Hormozi" style captions word-by-word.

Creating just *one* Short can take an hour. To grow on TikTok, you need to post 3 times a day. The math doesn't work.

### The Solution: AI curation engines.
**OpusClip** is an AI tool designed to solve exactly this problem. It doesn't just "crop" video. It "watches" your long video, analyzes the conversation, and picks out the funniest, most interesting hooks automatically.

Then, it uses face detection to keep the speaker centered and applies animated captions instantly.

Here is how to turn one video into a week's worth of TikTok content in 5 minutes.

### The Tutorial: The "Infinite Content" Workflow

#### Step 1: Grab your Link
You don't even need to upload a file. Just go to your (or anyone else's) YouTube video and copy the link.
* *Pro Tip:* This works great for repurposing old content that is sitting dead on your channel.

#### Step 2: Paste into OpusClip
* **Go to OpusClip** and paste the URL.
* **The Magic:** Click "Get Clips in 1 Click."

#### Step 3: The AI Curation
The AI will process the video (usually takes ~5-10 minutes for a long video). When it's done, it presents you with **10-15 viral clips**.
* **Viral Score:** OpusClip gives each clip a score (e.g., "99 - Very High Chance of Virality") based on its analysis of current trends.
* **The Hook:** It automatically selects the punchiest starting sentence to grab attention.

#### Step 4: Customize the Captions
This is where the money is made.
* Click **"Edit Clip."**
* Go to the **Design** tab.
* Select a preset (like the yellow/bold style used by top creators). The AI highlights keywords automatically in different colors to keep retention high.

#### Step 5: Post Everywhere
Download your clips. You now have 10 separate video files.
* Upload them to **TikTok**, **YouTube Shorts**, and **Instagram Reels**.
* One long video has just become 30 pieces of content across three platforms.

### Why this is the best strategy for 2025
Algorithms today favor **frequency**. The more you post, the faster you grow. Manually editing clips makes frequency impossible. Using AI curation makes it inevitable.
