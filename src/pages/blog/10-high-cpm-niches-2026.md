### The Problem: Millions of views, zero money.
You worked hard. You got a video to hit 100,000 views. You excitedly check your revenue dashboard, and... you made $40.

This is the "Low RPM" trap. Most beginners start channels in "Gaming" or "Funny Compilations." The problem? Advertisers don't pay much to reach those audiences. You are trading your time for pennies.

To make a full-time income with fewer views, you need to enter **High-CPM (Cost Per Mille)** niches—industries where advertisers have deep pockets (like Finance, Tech, and Software). But historically, these niches were hard to break into because they required expert research and high production value.

### The Solution: AI makes you an "Expert" instantly.
In 2026, you don't need to be a financial analyst to run a Finance channel. You don't need to be a coder to run a Tech channel.

AI tools can now research complex topics, summarize market trends, and produce professional, stock-footage-heavy videos that look like they came from a newsroom. This allows you to enter "Smart" niches where the RPM is **$20–$50** (vs. $2 for gaming).

Here are the 10 niches where the money is hiding.

### The 10 High-CPM Niches for 2026

1.  **AI & Automation News:** Everyone wants to know about the latest AI tools. Software companies pay huge CPMs here.
2.  **Personal Finance & Investing:** The king of CPM. Credit cards, stock apps, and crypto platforms compete aggressively for ad slots.
3.  **SaaS (Software as a Service) Reviews:** B2B marketing. If you review business tools, you attract business owners.
4.  **Biohacking & Longevity:** Health supplements and "anti-aging" tech are booming industries with high affiliate payouts.
5.  **Sustainable Tech / Green Energy:** Solar panels, EV cars, and eco-homes are high-ticket items with matching ad budgets.
6.  **Digital Marketing / Side Hustles:** Teaching people how to make money online attracts ads from course sellers and platforms (like Shopify).
7.  **Luxury Travel:** Not just "travel vlogging," but specific guides on *luxury* resorts and credit card points.
8.  **Real Estate / Tiny Homes:** High interest rates mean agents are desperate for leads.
9.  **Legal & Insurance Education:** Boring? Yes. Profitable? Extremely. Insurance keywords have some of the highest costs on Google.
10. **Psychology & Self-Improvement:** High retention niche with easy sponsorship integration (BetterHelp, Audible).

### The Tutorial: Launching a "Finance News" Video in 15 Minutes

You picked **Niche #2 (Finance)**. How do you make a video about "The 2026 Housing Market" without being an expert?

#### Step 1: Research with Perplexity / ChatGPT
Don't guess the news. Use AI to find it.
* **Prompt:** *"Summarize the current state of the US housing market for Q1 2026. Include 3 bullish stats and 3 bearish stats. Format as a YouTube script about 'Should You Buy a House Now?'"*

#### Step 2: Generate with InVideo AI
* **Go to InVideo AI.**
* **Prompt:** *"Create a 8-minute video about the 2026 Housing Market. Use a professional, authoritative American male voice. Use b-roll of modern houses, construction sites, and animated graphs showing upward trends."*

#### Step 3: Add "Visual Data"
Finance viewers love charts.
* InVideo often auto-generates simple charts. If you need more, ask it: *"Add a scene showing a line graph going down representing interest rates."*

#### Step 4: Monetize
Upload to YouTube. Because you targeted "Housing Market," your ads might be for **Mortgage Lenders** or **Real Estate Apps**, which pay 10x more than a standard mobile game ad.
