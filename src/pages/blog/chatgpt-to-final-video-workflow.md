### The Problem: The "Copy-Paste" Purgatory.
You have a great script in ChatGPT. You have a video editor open in another tab. You have a stock footage site open in a third.

The process of moving that script into a video is painful. You have to break it down sentence by sentence, find a matching clip for every single line, and try to get the timing right. It feels like assembling a puzzle where the pieces are in three different rooms.

This "manual bridge" between text and video is where 80% of your time is wasted.

### The Solution: The Integrated "Prompt-to-Video" Pipeline.
The secret to speed isn't just using AI; it's using AI that *understands* other AI.

Instead of treating ChatGPT and your Video Editor as separate tools, you can use ChatGPT to write a **Structured Command** that your video generator understands perfectly.

Here is the exact workflow to go from a vague idea to a rendered MP4 without dragging a single clip manually.

### The Tutorial: The 3-Step Pipeline

#### Step 1: The "Architect" Prompt (ChatGPT)
Don't just ask ChatGPT for a script. Ask it for a *Production Brief*.
* **Open ChatGPT** and paste this specific prompt:
    > *"I want to make a YouTube Short about 'The Psychology of Color in Marketing'. Write a script, but format it as a prompt for an AI Video Generator. Describe the visual for each scene in brackets, and keep the voiceover under 60 seconds."*

* **The Result:** ChatGPT will give you a text block that looks like:
    > *[Visual: Split screen of red and blue brands] Narrator: "Did you know red makes you hungry?"*

#### Step 2: The "Handover" (InVideo AI)
Now, we feed that structured data into the video engine.
* **Open InVideo AI.**
* Select **"Script to Video"** workflow.
* **Copy** the entire output from ChatGPT and **Paste** it into InVideo.
* **Why this works:** InVideo's AI is smart enough to read the [Visual Descriptions] inside the brackets and search its stock library for those exact terms (e.g., "Split screen," "Red brand logos").

#### Step 3: The "Polish" (Voice & Text)
The video is generated. Now we just refine it.
* **Voice Check:** InVideo might pick a default voice. If you want more emotion, click "Edit" > "Change Voice" and select "American Male - Deep."
* **Subtitle Check:** Ensure the captions are in the center (safe zone for Shorts/TikTok).

#### Step 4: Export
Hit export. You just turned a text prompt into a visual story without searching for a single stock photo yourself.

### Why this changes everything
By using ChatGPT to "Direct" the video tool, you eliminate the decision fatigue of choosing clips. You become the editor-in-chief, not the manual laborer.

### Ready to build your pipeline?
You need the right engine to make this work. InVideo AI is the best tool currently available that understands complex script instructions.
