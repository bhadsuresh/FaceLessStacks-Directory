### The Problem: True Crime footage is expensive and hard to find.
If you are making a documentary about a cold case, you can't just use happy, bright corporate stock footage. You need police lights, dark alleyways, forensic labs, and moody rain scenes.

But finding this specific aesthetic is a nightmare.
* **Getty Images:** High quality, but costs $150+ *per clip*.
* **Free Sites (Pexels):** Very limited selection of "crime" footage.
* **The Copyright Trap:** Using news footage from other channels often leads to strikes.

Most True Crime creators spend 80% of their budget just buying 5 minutes of B-roll.

### The Solution: Use AI editors with "Integrated Premium Libraries".
Instead of buying a separate subscription to Storyblocks ($30/mo) and Shutterstock ($29/mo), the smartest creators use **AI Video Generators** that have these libraries *built-in* for free.

Tools like **InVideo AI** and **Pictory** pay the licensing fees for you. When you subscribe to them, you get unlimited access to millions of premium clips from Storyblocks and Getty Images at no extra cost. It is the cheapest way to get high-end footage.

### The Tutorial: Finding "Dark" Footage with AI

#### Step 1: The "Mood" Prompt
Don't search for "Police." Search for the *vibe*.
* **Open InVideo AI.**
* **Prompt:** *"Create a scene about a detective searching for clues at night. Use cinematic, dark, and moody lighting. Use slow-motion footage of flashing blue lights and yellow tape."*

#### Step 2: The "Keyword" Swap
If the AI picks a clip you don't like, use the integrated search.
* Click **"Edit" > "Media"**.
* Search for these specific True Crime keywords:
    * *"Noir"*
    * *"Forensic"*
    * *"Interrogation room"*
    * *"Dashcam style"*
    * *"Glitch effect"*

#### Step 3: The "Ken Burns" Effect
Static images kill retention. True Crime documentaries rely on slow zooms to create tension.
* InVideo automatically adds a "Slow Zoom" to static images of evidence or maps, mimicking the style of Netflix documentaries.
