      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Last Updated: December 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to The Faceless Creator Stack. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This policy explains how we handle your data.</p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p><strong>We do not require you to create an account to use this directory.</strong> Therefore, we do not store your name, email, or password in a database.</p>
      
      <h3>Cookies & Analytics</h3>
      <p>We may use third-party services (like Google Analytics or Vercel Analytics) that collect anonymous usage data (e.g., which pages you visited, how long you stayed). This helps us improve the site.</p>

      <h2>3. Affiliate Links and Third Parties</h2>
      <p>This website contains links to third-party websites (software tools). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites have their own privacy policies.</p>
      <p>When you click an affiliate link, a tracking cookie may be placed on your browser by the merchant (e.g., InVideo or Jasper) to track the referral. This cookie typically expires after 30-90 days.</p>

      <h2>4. Data Protection</h2>
      <p>Since we do not collect personal data directly (no signup forms), there is no personal user database to be compromised.</p>

      <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
      <p>If you have questions about this policy, please contact us at: bhadsuresh@gmail.com</p>
