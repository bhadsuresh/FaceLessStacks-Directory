      <h2>How We Monetize</h2>
      <p>Our goal is to provide the most useful directory of AI tools for faceless content creators. Operating this website requires resources (hosting, domain costs, and time spent curating tools).</p>
      <p>To keep this directory free for you to use, we use affiliate links. When you click a link labeled "Get Started," "Visit Site," or similar, it is likely an affiliate link.</p>

      <h2>Does this affect our reviews?</h2>
      <p><strong>No.</strong> We prioritize the quality and utility of the tool above all else. We do not accept payment in exchange for a positive review. If a tool is listed here, it is because we believe it brings genuine value to a creator's workflow.</p>

      <h2>Our Affiliate Partners</h2>
      <p>We participate in affiliate programs with software providers including, but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
